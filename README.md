# Nexus BVH
![teaser9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a56284f9-bfe7-49d1-b83a-6374537d7e9b)

**NexusBVH** is a fast and high-quality GPU BVH builder written in C++ and CUDA.

It implements the H-PLOC algorithm proposed by [Benthin et al. 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3675377), a high-performance BVH construction method designed for GPUs. H-PLOC constructs high-quality BVHs through hierarchical clustering of spatially nearby primitives in parallel, making it well-suited for real-time ray tracing applications.

## BVH Construction Benchmark

All times are in milliseconds and represent kernel execution times measured on the CPU side. Benchmarked on a **Ryzen 7 5700X, RTX 3070 8 Go.** 

BVH2 refers to the H-PLOC kernel with a search radius of 8. Radix sort is performed using 32-bit Morton codes. When using 64-bit Morton codes, sorting time is approximately **3x slower**.

## Prerequisites
NexusBVH is a CMake-based project and requires the following dependencies:

- [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (from NVIDIA)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) version 3.22 or higher

The project has been tested on both **Windows** (with Visual Studio) and **Ubuntu**.

## Build

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/StokastX/NexusBVH
   ```

2. **Generate the solution via cmake**:

   ``` sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

3. **Build the project**:
- On Linux: Use ```make``` on your preferred build system:

   ``` sh
   make -j
   ```
- On Windows (Visual Studio): Open the generated solution file in Visual Studio, and press F5 to build and run.
